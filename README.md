## Features

‚úÖ Project Features & Completed Tasks
This project implements several foundational backend concepts using Laravel with mock integrations and simulated environments. The following core features have been completed, fulfilling the minimum required functionality:

üîê Task 1: Subscription Management System (Mock Stripe Integration)
Designed a simple subscription management flow supporting multiple plans and billing cycles.

Implemented mock logic for handling Stripe payments, including simulated success and failure scenarios.

Built basic routes for subscribing, canceling, and viewing subscription status.

Demonstrated secure handling of API keys and sensitive data using environment configuration best practices.

üì¢ Task 2: Basic Real-time Notification System (Simulated WebSocket)
Set up Laravel event broadcasting to simulate real-time notifications (e.g., on user registration).

Created a minimal frontend interface to display received notifications.

Used Laravel's built-in broadcasting features without requiring third-party WebSocket services.

üöÄ Task 3: Product Data Caching Strategy
Identified performance bottlenecks in fetching product details from a large dataset.

Implemented caching using Laravel‚Äôs cache system (with Redis driver) to improve performance.

Demonstrated performance improvement by comparing response times before and after caching.

‚úÖ Task 4: Basic Task Management System with Queues
Built a basic task management module where users can create and view tasks.

Integrated Laravel queues to handle asynchronous job processing.

Configured a queued job to send a welcome email upon task creation.
